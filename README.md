* EJS - Template engine for dynamically generating HTML with Node.js.
* Axios - Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

### Backend
* Node.js - High performance and scalable backend runtime environment.
* Express.js - Flexible Node.js web app framework with extensive features and middleware.

### Database and Realtime Communication
* MongoDB - NoSQL database that provides flexibility and scalability. Facilitates easy integration with Node.js.
* Socket.io - For realtime bidirectional communication.

### Rationale
The technologies we chose are common tools used for building modern web applications that our team has experience with. 
They allow crafting a performant and scalable app with realtime capabilities. EJS is ideal for server-side rendering, 
enhancing the load performance, and its simplicity pairs well with Node.js. 
MongoDB complements this by providing a scalable, schema-less database, perfect for handling large and diverse datasets 
in a JSON-like format, which resonates with the JavaScript ecosystem. Bootstrap rounds out the stack by offering a 
vast variety of pre-styled components and a responsive grid system, enabling quick, visually appealing, and responsive 
UI design. This combination is particularly appealing for projects that require dynamic content generation, 
efficient data handling, and a robust, mobile-friendly user interface.
